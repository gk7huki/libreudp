Some simple example programs to get an idea
how to use the library.

To build the examples issue the following command on 
main level:
scons example

simplified_echo_server:
A naive implementation of ReUDP echo server...
A real implementation should use ACE reactor
to poll when acks should be sent and when
input arrives. TODO
Example: ./simplified_echo_server 16999

simplified_echo_client:
A naive implementation of ReUDP echo client..
A real implementation should use ACE reactor
to poll when acks should be sent and when
input arrives. TODO
Example: ./simplified_echo_client 16999
